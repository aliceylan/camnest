# Project Overview #
The aim of the project is to create a CAD software having these features:

-Importing DXF files.( DONE )

-Modifying the parts to insert lead-in/out entries points for cutting . ( DONE )

-Saving the sheet as DXF.

-Exporting the file to G code. ( DONE )

-Automatic nesting of parts in the drawing sheet.


# ROAD MAP #


V0.1 - IMPORTING A SINGLE DXF FILE IN THE DRAWING WINDOW.

V0.2 - INSERTING MULTIPLE PARTS in A SINGLE SHEET.

V0.3 -  EXPORTING TO G CODE.

V0.3.5-  PATH OPTIMIZATION.

V0.4 - MODIFYING PARTS FOR LEAD-IN LEAD-OUT.

V0.4.5-  Advanced Parts geometrical transformations.

V0.5 - CLEAN UPS / BUG FIXES

V0.5.5 - Path Optimization optimization :)

V0.6 - AUTO NESTING
